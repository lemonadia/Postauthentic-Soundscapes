          and privatization of the public sound space</p>
        <p class="hero-info">As far as we share the same space in the visual context, we can't say the same about our
          acoustic reality. To move through a modern urban public space is to move through a space with dozen sounds
          playing simultaneously, but to hear none of them.</br></br>
          Headphones, earphones and portable listening devices give us total control of our audio environment, which
          results in privatizing our public spaces. This issue has its pros and cons as well as its causes and effects.
          We create the noise we're escaping from. We long for the silence that we ourselves as an urban society are
          destroying. In a personalised-everything times we choose to control our soundscape with no afford &#8211;
          simply by
          cutting off our sonic reality. We create separate sonic worlds, post-authentic soundscapes without a chance
          for sound to be reflected in space. The only space for the sound to reverbe is our head.</p>

        <h2>XIX FUTURE VISIONS OF THE BOOK</h2>
        <p class="research-para">
          In 1894, over a century before the invention of e-readers and the rise of audiobook and podcast, French
          bibliophile Octave Uzanne predicted the decline of printed text with the advent of phonographic technology. He
          envisioned a future where reading would no longer be done through books, but rather through sound recordings.
          This prediction was ahead of its time and foreshadowed the current popularity of audiobooks and podcasts.
          </br>
          </br>
          The images in Uzanne's article were ahead of their time, with one picture depicting a man walking while
          listening to a book through an iPod-like device and headphones. Today, if we were to come across this person
          on a walk, we would likely be more taken aback by his clothing than by the technology he's using.

        <h2>FIRST IN-EAR DEVICES</h2>
        <p class="research-para">
          The practice of using listening devices inserted in the ear has a history of over two centuries. The first
          device of this kind was not created for listening to music, however.
          Rene Laennec, a physician from France, is credited with the invention of the stethoscope in 1816. He developed
          the device while working at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris. The original stethoscope consisted of a
          single wooden tube and was designed to avoid direct contact between the physician and the patient. Laennec
          noticed that sounds could be amplified by placing a rolled piece of paper between the patient's chest and his
          ear.</br>
          Several improvements to the stethoscope were made in the following years. In 1851, Irish physician Arthur
          Leared created a binaural stethoscope, and in 1852, George Philip Cammann improved the design further, making
          it possible for the instrument to be commercially produced. This design, which uses both ears, has remained
          the standard to this day.

        <h2> FIRST IN EAR HEADPHONES
        </h2>
        <p class="research-para">
          Ernest Mercadier, a French engineer, patented the "bi-telephone" in 1891, which turned out to be the earliest
          recorded type of in-ear headphones. Despite being 130 years old, these lightweight and portable headphones
          closely resemble today's earbuds. Mercadier even proposed a rubber cover to prevent ear friction during usage.

        <h2> XIX CENTURY MUSIC SUBSCRIBTION SERVICE
        </h2>
        <p class="research-para">
          In pre-radio times, Londoners could enjoy music with friends via the Electrophone. This cutting-edge service
          offered subscribers the ability to listen to live theater shows through their telephone line using specialized
          headphones. It was like Spotify for opera. The headphones looked similar to modern ones, but instead of
          wearing them on top of the head, they were held with a rod attached to the earpads at the bottom.
          By 1908, 600 subscribers were receiving programs from 30 theaters and churches, and even collective listening
          events were organized.It's hard to believe, but the wealthier population was listening in this manner for
          more than 30 years, from 1895 to 1926.

        <h2>FIRST HEADPHONES</h2>
        <p class="research-para">
          So we come to 1910 when Nathaniel Baldwin creates in his kitchen the first modern headphones. For the first
          time, a pair of headpchones look like the ones you see today.
          Baldwin's headphones featured two cushioned ear cups and headbands for comfortable, hands-free wear on the
          head. He first created them in his kitchen in Utah
          for better listening to sermons at the local Mormon temple. Soon the US Navy saw the advantage of the
          headphones' design that didn't require an external power source, resulting in a large order and business
          opportunity for Baldwin. Unfortunately, poor financial decisions and a jail term for mail fraud brought about
          the downfall of his company.

        <h2>RADIO IN A HAT</h2>
        <p class="research-para">
          Wearable tech's potential to transform our relationship with technology has been discussed for decades. A
          prime example is the invention by an 18-year-old in 1922 of a radio that could be worn in a top hat. During
          the early 1920s, the radio industry was exciting and experimental, with some referring to it as "wireless
          telephone." This inventor foresaw the integration of radio in wearable tech. The only indicator that he was
          listening to the radio rather than the world around him was the headphones he wore.

        <h2>EARBUDS</h2>
        <p class="research-para">
          Not sure if these could have been inspired by the Mercadier's bi-telephone's in-ear headphones, but in May
          1926 issue of Science and Invention magazine issue from May 1926 published an article was published about the
          arrival of a new pair of earbud headphones. The magazine praised the benefits of these headphones, which are
          still relevant today. The article stated that the earbuds are lighter, take up less space, and provide a more
          comfortable experience during hot weather compared to traditional, cumbersome headphones.

        <p class="research-para">
          The invention and production of the first headphones, such as world's first dynamic headphones Beyerdynamic's
          DT 48 and first stereo headphones Koss' SP-3, had a significant impact on the future of portable listening.
          These early headphones introduced the concept of personal, private listening to music and other audio content,
          freeing people from the limitations of loudspeakers and allowing them to enjoy their favourite sounds
          everywhere without disturbing others.

          Furthermore, the development of headphones led to improvements in sound quality and increased portability. As
          technology progressed, headphones became smaller, lighter, and more comfortable, making them a practical and
          convenient option for listening on the go.

          Headphones are an essential part of daily life now, used for everything from music and podcasts to phone calls
          and gaming. The legacy of the first headphones continues to influence modern headphone design, with
          advancements in wireless technology and noise-cancellation that further enhance the listening experience.
